Unit Testing:
>Unit Testing is nothing but the Testing Methodology which is done At the Developer Level
>Unit Testing is Done After the Coding Phase
>Unit Testing is Must Done by the Developer Before and After the Integration
>Why is it imp?
Because At the Organizaton Level We Are the Only developer. different develoer write a code in differnet Standard so it might give error at the time of integration
So it is good to have unit testing before the Code Integration

and Same for after the Itegration if we do the unit testing then it is easier to trace the error
